# Summary

**Bridger College Student Union** - Sean Baris manages the website for the student union at Bridger College in Bozeman, Montana. The student union provides daily activities for the students on campus. As website manager, part of Sean’s job is to keep the site up to date on the latest activities sponsored by the union. At the beginning of each week, he revises a set of seven web pages detailing the events for each day in the upcoming week. Sean would like the website to display the current day’s schedule within an aside element. To do this, the page must determine the day of the week and then load the appropriate HTML code into the element. He would also like the Today at the Union page to display the current day and date. *Figure 9–45* shows a preview of the page he wants you to create.
