# Navigation Tabs List Styles

Go to the "Navigation Tabs List Styles" section. Amy has created a navigation list with the class name `tabs` that appears at the top of the page with the `body header`. Create a style rule for the `body > header nav.tabs` selector that changes the background to the image file *sf_back1.png* with no tiling, centered horizontally and vertically within the element and sized to cover the entire navigation list.

Amy wants the individual list items in the tabs navigation list to appear as tabs in a recipe box. She wants each of these “tabs” to be trapezoidal in shape. To create this effect, you’ll create a style rule for the `body > header nav.tabs li` selector that transforms the list item by setting the perspective of its 3D space to **50** pixels and rotating it **20°** around the x-axis.

As users hover the mouse pointer over the navigation tabs, Amy wants a rollover effect in which the tabs appear to come to the front. Create a style rule for the `body > header nav.tabs li` selector that uses the pseudo-element `hover` that changes the background color to **rgb(231, 231, 231)**.

# Left Section Styles

Go to the "Left Section Styles" section. Referring to *Figure 4–70*, notice that in the left section of the page, Amy has placed two vertical navigation lists. She wants these navigation lists to have rounded borders. For the vertical navigation lists in the left section, create a style rule for the `section#left nav.vertical` selector that adds a **1** pixel solid border with color value **rgb(20, 167, 170)** and has a radius of **25** pixels at each corner.

The rounded corner also has to apply to the `h1` heading within each navigation list. Create a style rule for `h1` elements nested within the left section vertical navigation list that sets the top-left and top-right corner radii to **25** pixels.
