# Create the Services Page
 Go to the *jtc_services.html* file in your HTML editor. Insert the same metadata in the document head to match what you did for the *jtc_index.html* file except name the page `title` **Jedds Tree Care Services**.

Go to the *jtc_index.html* file in your HTML editor and copy the `body` `header`. Then, go to the *jtc_services.html* file and paste the copied `header` into the document `body` so that both files share a common `header` design.

 Return to the *jtc_pages.txt* file in your text editor and copy the content of the third section, which contains information on the services offered by Jedds Tree Care. Be sure to copy the heading as well. Then, go to the *jtc_services.html* file in your HTML editor and paste the copied text directly after the header.

Mark the content describing Jedds Tree Care services as follows:
1. Mark the heading **Jedds Tree Care Services** as an `h1` heading.
2. Directly after the `h1` element, insert an inline image file for the *jtc_photo2.png* with the alternate text set to an empty text string (“”).
3. Mark each of the headings associated with individual services as `h2` headings. 
4. Mark each service description as a paragraph.

 Directly after the text of the last service, insert a `footer` element containing the following text: **Jedds Tree Care &#9830; 201 Edward Ave. &#9830; Lansing, MI 48930** where the &#9830; symbol is inserted using the character reference `&#9830;`.
