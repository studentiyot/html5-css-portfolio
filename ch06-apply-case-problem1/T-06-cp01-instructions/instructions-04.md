# Table Header Styles

Go to the "Table Header Styles" section. Create a style rule for the table header row group including every row within that row group that sets the row `height` to **60** pixels.

For the first `th` element in the first row of the table header row group, create a style rule that sets its font size to **2em**.

> Use the `first-of-type` pseudo-class to select the first table row and first heading cell.

For `th` elements in the first row of the table header row group that are not the first heading cell, create a style rule that sets the background color to **transparent** and the font color to **black**.

> Use the `not` selector with the `first-of-type` pseudo-class to select headings that are not first in the table row.

Open the _mi_pricing.html_ file in your browser and verify that the table layout and design resemble that shown in _Figure 6â€“53_.
