# CSS Grid Styles

Within the "CSS Grid Styles" section create a style rule that displays the `body` element as a grid with four columns of `length` **1fr**. Create a style rule for the `img` element with id `logo` so that the logo image spans three columns and has a `width` of **100%**. For the horizontal navigation list and the `footer` element create a style rule so that those elements span four columns. Create a style for the `aside` element to span two columns.

# Horizontal Navigation List Styles
Within the "Horizontal Navigation List Styles" section create a style rule for `li` elements nested within the horizontal navigation list that display each element as a block with a `width` of **12.5%** and floated on the left margin.
