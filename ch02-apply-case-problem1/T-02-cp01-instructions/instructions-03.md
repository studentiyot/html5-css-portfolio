# Structural Styles
Go to the "Structural Styles" section, creating a style rule that sets the background color of the `html` element to the value **hsl(91, 8%, 56%)**.

 Add a style rule for the `body` element to set the background color to the value **hsl(58, 31%, 84%)** and the font of the `body` text to the font stack: **‘Palatino Linotype’**, **‘Book Antiqua’**, **Palatino**, **serif**.
 
 Create a style rule for the `header` element that sets the background color to **black**.

Create a style rule for every paragraph that sets the margin space to **0** pixels and the padding space to **5** pixels on top and **25** pixels on the right, bottom, and left. For paragraphs that are direct children of the `body` element, create a style rule that sets the font size to **1.1em** and horizontally centers the paragraph text.

Create a style rule for the `address` element that sets the font style to **normal** with a font size of **0.9em**, horizontally centered on the page. Set the top and bottom padding to **10** pixels.

# Navigation Styles
 Next, you’ll format the appearance of navigation lists on the page. Go to the "Navigation Styles" section and create a style rule for the `nav a` selector that displays the hypertext links using the font stack: **‘Trebuchet MS’**, **Helvetica**, **sans-serif**. Set the top and bottom padding to **10** pixels.

For every unvisited and previously visited hypertext link within a `nav` element, set the text color to **white**, remove underlining from the link text, and set the background color to the semitransparent value **hsla(0, 0%, 42%, 0.4)**.

For every `active` or `hovered` link in a `nav` element, set the text color to the semi-transparent value **hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.7)** and set the background color to the semi-transparent value **hsla(0, 0%, 42%, 0.7)**.
