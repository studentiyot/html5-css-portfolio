# Section Styles
Go to the "Section Styles" section of the style sheet. In this section, you’ll define the appearance of the four playbills. You’ll start with the `h1` headings from the sections. 

Create a style rule for the `section.playbill h1` selector that sets the font size to **3em** and the font weight to **normal**. Set the margin space around the `h1` headings to **0** pixels. Set the padding space to **20** pixels on top, **0** pixels on the right, **10** pixels on the bottom, and **20** pixels on the left.


Each playbill section is identified by a different ID value ranging from `play1` to `play4`. Create style rules that set a different background color for each playbill using the following background colors:
* ID: `play1` set to **hsl(240, 100%, 88%)**
* ID: `play2` set to **hsl(25, 88%, 73%)**
* ID: `play3` set to **hsl(0, 100%, 75%)**
* ID: `play4` set to **hsl(296, 86%, 86%)**
 
Each playbill section heading will also have a different font. For the `h1` headings within the four different playbills, create style rules to apply the following font stacks:
* ID: `play1` set to **Champagne**, **cursive**
* ID: `play2` set to **Grunge**, **‘Times New Roman’**, **Times**, **serif**
* ID: `play3` set to **Impact**, **Charcoal**, **sans-serif** 
* ID: `play4` set to **Dobkin**, **cursive**
