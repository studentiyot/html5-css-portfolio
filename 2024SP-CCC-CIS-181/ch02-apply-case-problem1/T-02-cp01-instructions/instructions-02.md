# Document Setup
Open the *ph_plays.html* and *ph_styles.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file.

Next, go to the *ph_plays.html* file and within the document `head` create links to the *ph_layout.css* and *ph_styles.css* style sheet files. Take some time to study the content and structure of the document and then close the file.

Go to the *ph_styles.css* file in your editor, and at the top of the file before the comment section, define the character encoding used in the document as **utf-8**.

Randall has several web fonts that he wants used for the titles of the plays produced by the company. Add the following web fonts to the style sheet, using `@font-face` rules before the comment section:
1. The **Champagne** font using the *cac_champagne.woff* and *cac_champagne.ttf* files.
2. The **Grunge** font using the *1942.woff* and *1942.ttf* files.
3. The **Dobkin** font using the *DobkinPlain.woff* and *DobkinPlain.ttf* files.
