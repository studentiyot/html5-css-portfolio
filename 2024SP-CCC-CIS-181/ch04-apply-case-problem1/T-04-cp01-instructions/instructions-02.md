# Document Setup

Open the *sf_torte.html* and *sf_effects.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *sf_torte.html* file in your editor. Within the document `head` create links to the *sf_base.css*, *sf_layout.css*, and *sf_effects.css* style sheet files in that order. Take some time to study the structure of the document and then close the document.

# Body Header Styles
Go to the *sf_effects.css* file and within the "Body Header Styles" section, create a style rule for the `body` element to add drop shadows to the left and right border of the page body with an offset of **10** pixels, a blur of **50** pixels, and the color **rgb(51, 51, 51)**. Note that the right border is a mirror image of the left border.
