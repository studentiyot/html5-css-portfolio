# Summary

**Trophy Case Sports** - Sarah Nordheim manages the website for Trophy Case Sports, a sports memorabilia store located in Beavercreek, Ohio. She has asked you to work on creating a script for the shopping cart page. The script should take information on the items that the customer has purchased and present it in table form, calculating the total cost of the order. A preview of the page you will create is shown in **Figure 10–39**.

Sarah has already designed the page layout. Your job will be to use JavaScript to enter the order information (this task will later be handled by a script running on the website) and to write a script that generates the HTML code for the shopping cart table.
