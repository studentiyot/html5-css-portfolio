# Document Setup

Open the *sp_home.html* and *sp_layout.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *sp_home.html* file and within the document `head`, create links to the *sp_base.css*, *sp_styles.css*, and *sp_layout.css* style sheet files.

# Window and Body Styles

Open the *sp_layout.css* file. Go to the "Window and Body Styles" section. Create a style rule for the `html` element that sets the `height` of the browser window at **100%**. Create a style rule for the page `body` that sets the `width` to **95%** of the browser window ranging from **640** pixels up to **960** pixels. Horizontally center the page `body` within the browser window. Karen wants to ensure that the height of the page body is always at least as high as the browser window itself. Set the minimum height of the browser window to **100%**. Finally, add a style rule to display all inline images as blocks.
