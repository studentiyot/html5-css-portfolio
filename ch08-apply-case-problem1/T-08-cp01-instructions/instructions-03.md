# Video Player Styles

Next, go to the _ws_media.css_ file and within the "Video Player" Styles section, insert a style rule that displays `video` elements as blocks with a `width` of **90%** and horizontally centered by setting the top/bottom margins to **5** pixels and the left/right margins to **auto**.

Create a media query for screen devices with a minimum `width` of **521** pixels. Within the media query, create a style for `video` elements that sets the `width` of the player to **360** pixels, floated on the right margin with a margin width of **10** pixels.

# Track Styles

Within the "Track Styles" section, create a style rule for caption cues that displays the text in a **1.3em** **sans-serif** font with a text color of **rgb(221, 128, 160)**, and a background color of **rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)**.

Load the _ws_jfk.html_ file in the browser preview. Test the page by playing the video clip of Kennedyâ€™s speech. Verify that captions are added to the speech, matching the words uttered by the president.

> If your captions appear white on a gray background, move the mouse pointer away from the video player so that the video slider is not showing.

> The audio will not be audible using the browser preview in the lab environment.
