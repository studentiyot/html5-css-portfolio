# Document Setup

Open the *ws_jfk.html* and *ws_media.css* files and enter your **name** and the **date** in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the *ws_jfk.html* file and insert a `link` to the *ws_media.css* style sheet file. Take some time to study the content and structure of the document.

# Insert the Video Clip
Scroll down to the `article` element and directly below the `h1` heading, insert a video clip with the controls enabled, displaying the poster image *ws_jfk_poster.png* file. Add two possible sources to the video clip: *ws_jfk_speech.mp4* and *ws_jfk_speech.webm*, including the **mime-type** for each video source.

After the two video sources, add a captions track with the `label` **Speech Captions** using the source file *ws_captions.vtt*. If a browser does not support embedded video, display the paragraph: **To play this video clip, your browser needs to support HTML5**.

# Add Track Cues
Open the *ws_captions.vtt* file and add an initial line to the text file indicating that this file is in WEBVTT format.
Add the following track cues to the *ws_captions.vtt* file, labeling the captions **1** through **12**  (times are in parenthesis):
1. **(00:01.00 - 00:004.000) We observe today**,
2. **(00:04.000 - 00:06.000) not a victory of party**,
3. **(00:06.000 - 00:10.000) but a celebration of freedom –**
4. **(00:10.000 - 00:12.000) symbolizing an end**,
5. **(00:12.000 - 00:15.000) as well as a beginning –**
6. **(00:15.000 - 00:17.000) signifying renewal**,
7. **(00:17.000 - 00:19.000) as well as change.**
8. **(00:19.000 - 00:22.000) For I have sworn before you**
9. **(00:22.000 - 00:24.000) and Almighty God**
10. **(00:24.000 - 00:27.000) the same solemn oath**
11. **(00:27.000 - 00:30.000) our forebears prescribed**
12. **(00:30.000 - 00:33.000) nearly a century and three-quarters ago.**
