# Section Styles

Within the "Section Styles" section create a style rule for inline images within the `section` element that sets the `width` of the image to **50%** and centers the image using a top/bottom margin of **0** and a left/right margin of **auto**.

Create a style rule for paragraphs within the `section` element that sets the `width` of the paragraph to **70%** and centers the paragraph using a top/bottom margin of **0** and a left/right margin of **auto**.

# Customer Comment Styles

Go to the "Customer Comment Styles" section and create a style rule for the `aside` element setting the `width` to **75%** and the bottom padding to **30** pixels. The six `aside` elements will be displayed in two columns. For odd-numbered aside elements, use the `justify-self` grid property to place the element on the end (right) margin.

> Use the `nth-of-type(odd)` pseudo-class to select the odd-numbered `aside` elements.

Float inline images nested within the `aside` element on the left with a `width` of **20%** and float paragraphs nested within the `aside` element on the left with a `width` of **75%** and a left margin of **5%**.
