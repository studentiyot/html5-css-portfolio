# Summary

**Golden Pulps** - Devan Ryan manages the website Golden Pulps, where he shares tips on collecting and fun stories from the “golden age of comic books”—a period of time covering 1938 through the early 1950s. Devan wants to provide online versions of several classic comic books, which are now in the public domain. He’s scanned the images from the golden age comic book, America’s Greatest Comics 001, published in March, 1941, by Fawcett Comics and featuring Captain Marvel. He’s written the code for the HTML file and wants you to help him develop a layout design that will be compatible with mobile and desktop devices. *Figure 5–63* shows a preview of the mobile and desktop version of a page you’ll create.
