# Center Article Styles

Go to the "Center Article Styles" section. The `article` element contains an image and brief description of the Apple Bavarian Torte, which is the subject of this sample page. Create a style rule for the `section#center article` selector that adds the following:
1. A radial gradient to the background with a **white** center with a color stop of **30%** transitioning to **rgb(151, 151, 151)**.
2. A **1** pixel solid border with color value **rgb(151, 151, 151)** and a radius of **50** pixels.
3. A box shadow with horizontal and vertical offsets of **10** pixels with a **20** pixel blur and a color of **rgb(51, 51, 51)**.

# Blockquote Styles
Go to the "Blockquote Styles" section. Amy has included three sample reviews from users of the Save your Fork website. Amy wants the text of these reviews to appear within the image of a speech bubble. For every `blockquote` element, create a style rule that does the following:
1. Set the background image to the *sf_speech.png* file with no tiling and a horizontal and vertical size of **100%** to cover the entire block quote.
2. Use the `drop-shadow` filter to add a drop shadow around the speech bubble with horizontal and vertical offsets of **5** pixels, a blur of **10** pixels and the color **rgb(51, 51, 51)**.

Amy has included the photo of each reviewer registered on the site within the citation for each review. She wants these images to appear as circles rather than squares. To do this, create a style rule for the selector `cite img` that sets the border radius to **50%**.
